# Winter Term Messenger Project

We have three messenger classes in total. We have a class that changes a message into morse code,
a class that codes messages by an alphabet shift, and finally we have a carrier pigeon class that
also codes the message with numbers. John did the alphabet shift class, Michael did the morse code
class, and Palmer did the carrier pigeon class.
