# Winter Term Messenger Project

We have three messenger classes in total. We have a class that changes a message into morse code,
a class that codes messages by an alphabet shift, and finally we have a carrier pigeon class that
also codes the message with numbers. John did the alphabet shift class, Michael did the morse code
class, and Palmer did the carrier pigeon class.

The alphabet shift is an encoder than replaces each letter of the alphabet with letters five ahead
of the original letter. For example, a --> e, b --> f, and so on. Doing this makes the message impossible 
to read without decoding it. The decoder just does the same process in reverse. It shifts the alphabet 
by five in the other direction.
